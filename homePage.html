		<h2>Importance of Smart Drive</h2>
		<p>The main aim of this Smart drive technology is to analyze the road accidents in India at national, state, and metropolitan city level. 
		Analysis shows that the distribution of road accidental deaths and injuries in India varies according to age, gender, month and time. 
		Age group 30-59 years is the most vulnerable population group, though males face higher level of fatalities and injuries than their
		female counterparts. Moreover, road accidents are relatively higher in extreme weather and during working hours. Analysis of road accident
		scenario at state and city level shows that there is a huge variation in fatality risk across states and cities. Fatality risk in 16 out of 35 
		states and union territories is higher than the all India average. Although, burden of road accidents in India is marginally lower in its
		metropolitan cities, almost 50% of the cities face higher fatality risk than their moffusil counterparts. In general, while in many developed 
		and developing countries including China, road safety situation is generally improving, India faces a worsening situation. Without increased 
		efforts and new initiatives, the total number of road traffic deaths in India is likely to cross the mark of 250,000 by the year 2025. There 
		is thus an urgent need to recognize the worsening situation in road deaths and injuries and to take appropriate action.</P>
